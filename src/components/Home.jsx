            <p>your not-so-typical web developer. I'd rather be napping on a hammock by the beach, but life has other plans for me - like making websites.

            You see, I stumbled into the world of web development by accident. My dream job was to be a professional Netflix binge-watcher, but destiny had other ideas. So here I am, making websites and whatnot.

            I have this rare talent of turning procrastination into a fine art. My motto? 'Why do today what you can definitely do tomorrow?' I may not always be the fastest coder in the West, but I get there eventually, one coffee break at a time.
